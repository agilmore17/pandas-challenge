Fourth Challenge Assignment for U of R Data Bootcamp

This project was definitely the easiest that I've had to complete so far! Working with Jupyter is a breeze compared to using VScode to perform analysis on data. 

The only section that I had problems with during this assignment was the very first section on "School Summary". I turned to the internet and found what seemed to be a user guide or source documents for pandas, and I relied on this page heavily to complete this part of the assignment: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.set_index.html

Luckliy, apart from that section, it was a lot of referencing back to class notes and reviewing the Zoom for sorting to make sure that the syntax was right to get a proper ascending / descending setup for the values.
